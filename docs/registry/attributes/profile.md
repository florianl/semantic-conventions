## Profile Frame Attributes

Describes the origin of a single frame in a Profile.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="profile-frame-type" href="#profile-frame-type">`profile.frame.type`</a> | string | Describes the interpreter or compiler of a single frame. | `cpython` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`profile.frame.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

## Profile Mapping Attributes

Describes the mapping in more detail.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="profile-mapping-symbolization" href="#profile-mapping-symbolization">`profile.mapping.symbolization`</a> | string | Describes the symbolization level of the mapping. | `symbols` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`profile.mapping.symbolization` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `lines_inline` | Full, most-desired level of symbolization. [1] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `lines_no_inline` | Limited debug information is available. [2] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `none` | No symbolization was attempted for the mapping. [3] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `symbols` | Limited symbol information is available. [4] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `unspecified` | Unknown or unassigned. [5] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1]:** All of function and file names, line numbers and inline frames are
available. This level indicates that full debug information was
available for the binary. It is also what managed languages like
Java provide.

**[2]:** Function, file names and line numbers are assigned but the inline
frames are not available.
This is a somewhat exotic case specific to C++ binaries with split DWARF
information. When symbolization is done against such a binary and the *.dwp
file is not available, the DWARF is available only partially which results
in this more complete but still partial symbolization level.
This level is never practically useful for managed languages.

**[3]:** No symbolization was attempted for the mapping and it's known to be a
native mapping with no pre-populated symbol information. Function and file
names, line numbers and inline frames are absent for all locations for the
mapping.
This level is common for a native (e.g. C++) mapping in a profile emitted
by a production profiling collector since no symbolization is typically
attempted on the host as debug information is usually not shipped to
production machines.
The level is rarely used with managed language mappings like Java since
symbolization for those languages is typically done on the host.

**[4]:** Function names are assigned but may be imprecise. File names, line numbers
and inline frames are missing.
This level is encountered when the symbolization is performed for a C++
binary that has symbol table (.symtab) present, but no DWARF. Such a symbol
table records top-level symbol names, but it won't have the more granular
function and line breakdown.
The level is rarely used with managed languages like Java since their
symbolization information is typically more complete.

**[5]:** Clients can try to determine the actual level heuristically from
the presence of function and file names, line numbers and inline
frames.
